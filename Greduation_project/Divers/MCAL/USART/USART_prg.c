/*----------------------------------------------------------
 * USART Configuration
 *
 * Asynchronous Mode:
 * - No separate clock wire is used.
 * - Both transmitter and receiver agree on the same baud rate
 *   (e.g., 9600 bps) to communicate.
 *
 * No Parity:
 * - No extra bit is added for error detection.
 * - Data frame is shorter and transmission is faster.
 *
 * 1 Stop Bit:
 * - One stop bit marks the end of each transmitted frame.
 * - This is the most commonly used configuration.
 *
 * 8-bit Data:
 * - Each transmitted character consists of 8 data bits.
 * - Allows sending values from 0 to 255 (ASCII characters,
 *   numbers, symbols, etc.).
 *
 * Clock Polarity:
 * - Used only in Synchronous mode.
 * - Ignored in Asynchronous mode.
